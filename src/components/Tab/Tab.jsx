        <b>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of th</b>e printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever
        since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        <a> essentially unchanged. It</a> was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.
